= Introduction =

As we talk, is really important to make a good project design to achieve our objectives. Use libraries is good for that, the idea is to develop reusable code in the most general possible way (Using interfaces and inheritance), so we can use that code further without getting worried of how is implemented as we know is working and is implemented with the best characteristics to improve performance that we found.


= Details =

Our library is "Busqueda", the code is spread in some logical units according to what it does. In Java, that units are named Packages.
For example, as we are talking of search, we have divided the project in Deep First Search and Breadth First Search.

As we said in the introduction, we were going to make the code in the library as general as possible. But of course, there are some things that depends of the problem to be solved. For example, in all searches we need to know what are the children of a given node so we can build the tree. So what do we need in order to mix the general with the particular things?

Here is when we use the interfaces, in the interfaces we declare the particular things that we are going to need to solve any problem. In these way we are sure that the object that implements that interface will have those characteristics and we can safely make our algorithm without thinking in particular problems.

To understand better the idea, I strongly recommend to download the source code and check the example of the puzzle. See what part of the source code is made in what project. To even understand better you can make another sample in AppsBusqueda that uses the library and notice that you don't need to rewrite the Breadth first search algorithm.
